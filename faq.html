<dt>How come I can only choose <u>sedentary</u> for lifestyle?</dt>
<dd>Sedentary is the baseline for being awake 16 hours a day and mostly sitting around with maybe a trip to the grocery store. If you have activity beyond this level, enter it as exercise. This is too easy to get wrong and will greatly screw up predictions, so it will not be an option.

<dt>Should I exercise?</dt>
<dd>Exercise, for those that are really overweight, is for entertainment purposes only. If you enjoy going for a walk every day, have at it. Other than that, it is not a good way to lose weight and only makes you hungrier. It's better to eat 2000 calories and do no exercise than eat 2500 calories and do 300 calories of exercise. That exercise is somehow valuable for weight loss is a myth perpetuated by the food industry. "If you just exercise you can eat whatever you want." False. You'd have to run ten miles to burn off a Big Mac and fries. It doesn't help that the human body is the most efficient running machine on the planet, and our ancestors hunted not by outsmarting animals but simply following the animal around for days until it collapsed of exhaustion.

<dt>I have a low metabolism.</dt>
<dd>You may, but not low enough for it to be relevant to these calculations. Saying you have a significantly lower metabolism than someone else is like saying you have a car that gets 60 mpg while everyone gets 30 mpg with the same engine. If your metabolism is truly different, more than 10% slower than the average person's, and you have no glaring ill effects, such as constant fatigue and cold intolerance, congratulations! You are the next stage of human evolution, possessing a unique body chemistry. Instead of wasting time on this site, visit an endocrinologist for testing. Your unique metabolic processes will soon be in a medical journal. Even if you have untreated clinical hypothyroidism (low metabolism) complete with all its debilitating symptoms, this site will still work but when it predicts you've lost 10 pounds, you will have only lost 9 pounds. <b>That</b> is how invariant human metabolism is.
