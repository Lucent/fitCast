<h1>WeightCast Questions</h1>
<dl>

<dt>What is WeightCast?</dt>
<dd>WeightCast is not a diet web site. It is a very precise scale. You can use it to gain weight just as easily as you can to lose weight.</dd>

<dt>Why will this work when calorie counting has failed for me in the past?</dt>
<dd>Calorie counting is <strong>not</strong> the key component of this plan. It is a requirement for success but not the reason you will succeed. What makes this different is you will eventually displace the extrensic motivation of seeing the scale change with the intrinsic motivation of knowing exactly how much weight you've lost or gained each day. In all but the longest term, the scale will actually be less accurate at showing your weight loss than the site predictions.

<dt>How come I can only choose <u>sedentary</u> for lifestyle?</dt>
<dd>Sedentary is the baseline for being awake 16 hours a day and mostly sitting around with maybe a trip to the grocery store. If you have activity beyond this level, enter it as exercise. This is too easy to get wrong and will greatly screw up predictions, so it will not be an option.

<dt>Should I exercise?</dt>
<dd>Exercise, for those that are really overweight, is for entertainment purposes only. If you enjoy going for a walk every day, have at it. Other than that, it is not a good way to lose weight and only makes you hungrier. It's better to eat 2000 calories and do no exercise than eat 2500 calories and do 300 calories of exercise. That exercise is somehow valuable for weight loss is a myth perpetuated by the food industry. "If you just exercise you can eat whatever you want." False. A marathon runner only uses up as many calories in a Bloomin' Onion to run the entire marathon. It doesn't help that the human body is the most efficient running machine on the planet, and our ancestors hunted not by outsmarting animals but simply following the animal around for days until it collapsed of exhaustion.

<dt>I have a low metabolism.</dt>
<dd>You may, but <a href="http://examine.com/faq/does-metabolism-vary-between-two-people.html">not low enough for it to be relevant to these calculations</a>. Saying you have a significantly lower metabolism than someone else is like saying you have a car that gets 60 mpg while everyone gets 30 mpg with the same engine. If your metabolism is truly different, more than 10% slower than the average person's, and you have no glaring ill effects, such as constant fatigue and cold intolerance, congratulations! You are the next stage of human evolution, possessing a unique body chemistry. Instead of wasting time on this site, visit an endocrinologist for testing. Your unique metabolic processes will soon be in a medical journal. Even if you have untreated clinical hypothyroidism (low metabolism) complete with all its debilitating symptoms, this site will still work but when it predicts you've lost 10 pounds, you will have only lost 9 pounds. <b>That</b> is <a href="http://examine.com/faq/how-much-does-metabolic-rate-vary-between-individuals.html">how invariant human metabolism is</a>.

<dt>Calorie counting is a hassle.</dt>
<dd>Entering a day's food will take five minutes tops. It involves no sweating and requires no willpower. There's no actual hassle involved in searching for the foods you ate and entering them on a web site. Your actual objection isn't the "hassle," it's that you don't want to confront the quantity you're eating. You want to sit down and binge and then not think about having just put 2000 calories into your body and the guilt accompanying it. If this is the case, calorie counting won't work for you. First, you'll need to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Taming-Feast-Beast-Recognize-Struggle/dp/0440507243/">deal with binge eating disorder</a>. After a week or two of eating sensible meals, you can transition to counting calories.

<dt>What's the hard part?</dt>
<dd>The most important part of using this site properly, the very hardest thing you'll have to do, and the only thing required for success, is to <strong>enter your foods on days you overeat</strong>. It is unpleasant facing up to a bad day of eating, but if you can do this, your motivation will be more tied to these numbers and less to the scale. You'll also be able to see that even a day of horrible eating may only cost you half a pound in weight gain, something that can be undone in a couple days of eating right. Not entering a day when you eat a Bloomin' Onion will mess up predictions by almost a pound, so this is an absolute necessity.

<dt>Sometimes my weight gets stuck (plateaus) for weeks at a time, so I have to change my routine.</dt>
<dd>No. You do not have to change your routine or "snap" your body into losing weight when it gets "stuck" by exercising differently or eating different amounts. Plateaus are a complete observational fiction and even believing in them can compromise your motivation. The numbers work because of thermodynamics and basic physical principles at the molecular level. If the numbers say you are losing weight, fat is indeed melting off your body in exactly the amount described. It is completely contradictory to suggest that calorie counting works at all, and at the same time suggest that occasionally it does not work for periods of time. Either you lose weight as predicted, or something magical is going on and you don't.

The scale does not show this due to variations in glycogen, water, and muscle mass. Drink a cup of water. That's half a pound of weight right there. It's vitally important, for your own motivation, to understand that when you go a week without the scale showing a change and then all of a sudden lose two pounds, it is <strong>not</strong> that you didn't lose any weight and then suddenly lost. <strong>You were losing small amounts every day just as the numbers predicted</strong> and this loss was masked by variations in water weight.

<dt>Should I eat low fat, high protein, low carbs or some other combination of nutrients?</dt>
<dd><a href="http://examine.com/faq/what-should-i-eat-for-weight-loss.html">It doesn't matter.</a> If you want to eat only cupcakes, go for it. The only relevant number is the total calories. However, budgeting calories works the same as budgeting money. Just as if you only have $1500 to spend a month, you'll cut back on luxuries and find ways to make your money go further, if you have only 1500 calories to spend a day, you'll find yourself discovering foods that keep you full longer for fewer calories. These are usually high protein or high fat foods. Once your hunger is under control after a few weeks, you may want to start incorporating more delicious sugary snacks. How you spend your calories is your own journey.

<dt>Should I eat many small meals a day?</dt>
<dd><a href="http://examine.com/faq/do-i-need-to-eat-six-times-a-day-to-keep-my-metabolism-high.html">It doesn't matter.</a> One meal a day or six doesn't make a difference. Eating during the day or <a href="http://examine.com/faq/does-eating-at-night-make-it-more-likely-to-gain-weight.html">at night</a> doesn't make a difference. Just the number of calories matter. Your only task is to distribute them to avoid hungry.

<dt>Is it possible to eat too little?</dt>
<dd>While <a href="http://examine.com/faq/how-do-i-stay-out-of-starvation-mode.html">starvation mode is a myth</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615615">it may not be possible to lose more than 22 calories per pound of fat per day</a>.
